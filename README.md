# rainbow-group-project
This is the 100Devs LGBTQ+ project group repo! 

## Project
The goal of this project was to be able to look up businesses to see their "LGBTQ+ Acceptance Rating". We currently have no way to store or implement an actual rating system, so we will be returning a random number as a rating (with a disclaimer saying this is currently random and not a reflection of the business). When users look up a business, general information about it is also returned (using Yelp's API).

### Future Features
- allow users to submit ratings for businesses and display the current average rating
